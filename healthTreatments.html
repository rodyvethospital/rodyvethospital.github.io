                <span id="med1">Running nose in dogs:</span> Any time your dog develops an excessive runny nose, 
                schedule an appointment with a primary care veterinarian doc to determine the underlying causes. 
                If your dog also has breathing difficulties, bloody nasal discharge, a high fever, 
                or extreme lethargy then, he should receive emergency medical attention immediately.

             <p class="parDogQuote2">
                <span id="med2ned">Dog agression, Fighting, Biting, attacking:</span>Never use physical or other 
                forms of punishments to adddiscipline aggression in your dog. This includes both hitting and using spray bottles 
                to squirt water on dogs. Loud, sustained shouting is also counterproductive for treating aggression.

                <span id="med3">My dog is dying :</span> Euthanasia allows you to say goodbye to your pet before their 
                quality of life becomes unacceptable or their pain becomes unbearable. Your veterinarian or hospice care
                 team can help you to determine what options are best for your pet.

     <h1 class="dogRespHeadhealth">Understand when they are feeling ill, but it is hard to know if they understand the finality 
        of their own passing. It is not uncommon for an ill dog to begin to hide as their time draws near, but this could 
        be a symptom of their worsening illness and not a direct sign they know the end is coming.. Please have a look on our <a href="medications.html">treatments</a></h1>
